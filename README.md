# DataFormatExploration

In this repo, I will explore various data formats by writing encoders/decoders.
This is mainly meant to satisfy my own curiosity, but feel free to explore!

Every File Format will have its own directory, this may lead to repetition of code, but we'll deal with that when we get to it.

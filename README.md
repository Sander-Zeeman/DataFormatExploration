# DataFormatExploration

In this repo, I will explore various data formats by writing encoders/decoders.
This is mainly meant to satisfy my own curiosity, but feel free to explore!

Every data format will have a single .hs file dedicated to it.
General helper functions for reading binary will be included in a separate directory.
